  FOREWORD
  --------
   ___
    |
   _|_ originally created this engine out of a sense of preservation. GM8-based
  engines and games were rotting and obsolete when I learned of this community,
  and the making of Guy Remastered was a painful process where we slowly
  refurbished a 9-year-old GM8 engine up to spec. I wasn't satisfied with the
  state of Studio engines either, and greatly due to Studio's own problems, the
  general programming workflow felt far removed from that simplicity of opening
  Game Maker and getting to work in a matter of seconds.

    And so, using Guy Remastered as a base, I decided to create a unified GM8
  project that would satisfy my own standards for what an engine should aim to
  do for its user - just enough so that you don't need to spend so much time
  fiddling with the internals to get things to cooperate, but also not so much
  that it overwhelms you. Several people have joined my endeavours over time,
  and I'm thankful for their contributions to this project.
  
    Making a game should be a creative process, not a laborious one.
  
    I dedicate this engine to my good friend Natsu, who's been running his game
  ideas through me since we met in 2012, and my good friend Floogle, who drives
  me to complete great things. Great times were had and will continue to be.

  Game Maker 8.2?
  ---------------

  Game Maker 8.1 has been deprecated as a platform. The engine has been
  developed and tested in 8.2 and is designed to make use of its new features.
  You can find 8.2 and related resources in the support discord server.
