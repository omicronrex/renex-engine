/*
    if a trigger is inside one of these rectangles, it'll only
    trigger any dynamite instances also within the rectangle.

    use this to separate triggers in big rooms that use a lot of triggers.

    note: this does not apply to TriggerFree, as that object
    always works across the entire room with no boundary checks.
    also note that this object will keep instances active inside.
